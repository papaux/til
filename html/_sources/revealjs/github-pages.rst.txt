Host on github pages
--------------------------

Making your slides available online is very easy with github pages.

1. Go to your github repository from github.com
2. Open Settings
3. Go to Pages
4. Chose the source branch and the directory and save

From there, github will automatically start building your website.

If using revealjs as a submodule - do not worry! It will work out of the box.
